The files will be save in the `public/assets/images` folder and store their `paths` in MongoDB. This allows you to easily access and manipulate the files along with their associated data. If you want to remove a file, you can delete the corresponding document in MongoDB, which in turn will remove the file from the images folder as well as its associated document. See video example.
